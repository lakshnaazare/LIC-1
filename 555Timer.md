# Monostable Multivibrator Using 555 Timer IC

## 📌 Objective
To design and simulate a monostable multivibrator circuit using the 555 Timer IC that generates an output pulse of 0.5 milliseconds duration when triggered.

---

## 🧠 Theory

A monostable multivibrator is a pulse-generating circuit that has only one stable state. Upon receiving a trigger input, it transitions to a temporary quasi-stable state and stays in that state for a predetermined time before returning to its original stable state.

In a 555 timer configured in monostable mode:
- The output remains LOW until a trigger pulse (active LOW) is applied.
- Once triggered, the output goes HIGH for a specific duration defined by the RC time constant.
- The duration of the HIGH output (pulse width) is given by:

\[
T = 1.1 \times R \times C
\]

Where:
- T = pulse width (seconds)
- R = resistance (ohms)
- C = capacitance (farads)

This configuration is useful for applications like timer circuits, pulse generation, switch debouncing, and delay circuits.

|------------------|----------------------|
| 555 Timer IC      | Standard DIP package |

## 📐 Design Calculation

Given:
- Desired pulse width (T) = 0.5 ms = 0.0005 s
- Capacitance (C) = 1 µF = 1×10⁻⁶ F

Using the monostable formula:
\[
R = \frac{T}{1.1 \times C} = \frac{0.0005}{1.1 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 454.54\ \Omega
\]

A resistor value of 470 Ω (nearest standard value) can be used.

## 📈 Observations

- The circuit remains in a LOW state until a trigger is received.
- On receiving a trigger, the output switches to HIGH and remains HIGH for a time determined by the RC constant.
- After the capacitor voltage exceeds 2/3 of Vcc, the timer resets and the output returns to LOW.
- With C = 1 µF and R ≈ 454.54 Ω, the output pulse width measured was close to 0.5 ms.

# ASTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR


## Objective

To design and implement a circuit that generates a pulse waveform of 0.5 ms duration using an astable multivibrator, differentiator, clipper, and monostable multivibrator.

## Introduction

Pulse generation is a fundamental task in digital and analog electronics, widely used in timing circuits, control systems, and communication modules. This project demonstrates how a basic analog circuitry can be designed to generate a fixed-width pulse of 0.5 ms using common building blocks like multivibrators and signal shaping circuits.

## Theory

### 1. Astable Multivibrator

An astable multivibrator continuously switches between high and low states without external triggering. It is used to generate a square waveform. A 555 timer in astable mode uses two resistors (R1 and R2) and a capacitor (C) to define its time period:

- Time period:  
  T = 0.693 × (R1 + 2 × R2) × C  
- Frequency:  
  f = 1.44 / ((R1 + 2 × R2) × C)

This square wave serves as the base signal for pulse shaping.

### 2. Differentiator Circuit

A differentiator converts the edges of the square wave into spike pulses by using a capacitor and resistor:

- Time constant: τ = R × C

A small time constant ensures the output is a narrow voltage spike at each rising and falling edge of the input signal.

### 3. Clipper Circuit

A clipper (using a diode) allows only positive spikes to pass through and blocks or clips negative spikes. This results in clean, single-direction pulses suitable to trigger the next stage.

### 4. Monostable Multivibrator

A monostable multivibrator has one stable state and one temporary state. Triggered by a positive spike, it switches to the unstable state for a fixed time:

- Pulse duration: T_pulse = 1.1 × R × C

For 0.5 ms output, suitable R and C are selected accordingly.

## Circuit Operation

1. The astable multivibrator produces a continuous square wave.
2. The differentiator generates spike pulses at each transition.
3. The clipper circuit removes the negative pulses, keeping only the positive spikes.
4. Each positive spike triggers the monostable multivibrator, producing a 0.5 ms pulse output.
